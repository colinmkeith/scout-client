= Installing the Scout Client

RubyGems is the preferred easy install method for the Scout Client.

To get the latest version, simply enter the following into your command 
prompt:

	$ sudo gem install scout --source http://gems.scoutapp.com

You must have RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] installed for
the above to work.

To run the Installation Wizard, simply enter the following into your
command prompt:

  $ scout

You'll need your Client Key to continue.
