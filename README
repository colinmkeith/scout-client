Setup instructions ---

1. cd /var
2. svn co http://svn.highgroove.com:8080/spy_client/trunk spy
3. Try running it w/o cron
   OSX:    /usr/local/bin/ruby /var/spy/bin/sspy CLIENT_KEY
   LINUX:  /usr/bin/ruby /var/spy/bin/sspy CLIENT_KEY
4. Add to etc/crontab (this is for every 10 minutes):
*/10  *  * * *  root /usr/bin/ruby /var/spy/bin/sspy CLIENT_KEY

To see some logging of the clients actions while testing it on your platform, launch with:

  /path/to/spy_client/bin/sspy -v CLIENT_KEY

If you want even more logging, use:

  /path/to/spy_client/bin/sspy -v -l debug CLIENT_KEY

And if you want to log to a file when using cron, use:

  /path/to/spy_client/bin/sspy -v -l debug CLIENT_KEY > /path/to/file.log

If you are testing with a locally installed spy server, you can use the -s option to aim the client at your server:  -s http://localhost:8000/.
