== Description

as flexible and simple as possible.

Scout is a product of Highgroove Studios.
Please visit http://scoutapp.com for more information.

== Installing

Install the Scout gem:

  $ sudo gem install scout

Then simply run:

  $ scout

to run the installation wizard.  You'll need your server key to continue. Get the server key from your account at http://scoutapp.com

== Running the Scout Client

The Scout client has several modes of operation and commands.  The normal, intended usage is through a scheduled interval with no output.

Normal checkin with server:
  $ scout [OPTIONS] SERVER_KEY
  ... OR ...
  $ scout [OPTIONS] run SERVER_KEY

Install:
  $ scout
  ... OR ...
  $ scout [OPTIONS] install

Local plugin testing:
  $ scout [OPTIONS] test PATH_TO_PLUGIN [PLUGIN_OPTIONS]


SERVER_KEY is the identification key assigned by your account at http://scoutapp.com

PATH_TO_PLUGIN is the file system path to a Ruby file
that contains a Scout plugin.

PLUGIN_OPTIONS are one or more options in the form:
key1=val1 key2=val2
These options will be used for the plugin run.


== Setting up in cron

Configure Scout to run every minute. Typically, this will look like:

  * * * * *  deploy /usr/bin/scout SERVER_KEY

It's often helpful to log the output to a file. To do so:

  * * * * *  deploy /usr/bin/scout SERVER_KEY > /path/to/anywhere/scout.out 2>&1
