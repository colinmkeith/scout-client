== Installing

After installing the scout gem:

  $ sudo gem install scout

Simply run:

  $ scout

to run the installation wizard.  You'll need your Client Key to continue.

== Running the Scout Client

The Scout client has several modes of operation and commands.  The normal, intended usage is through a scheduled interval with no output.

Normal checkin with server:
  $ scout [OPTIONS] CLIENT_KEY
  ... OR ...
  $ scout [OPTIONS] run CLIENT_KEY

Install:
  $ scout
  ... OR ...
  $ scout [OPTIONS] install

Local plugin testing:
  $ scout [OPTIONS] test PATH_TO_PLUGIN [PLUGIN_OPTIONS]

Clone a client setup:
  $ scout [OPTIONS] clone CLIENT_KEY NEW_CLIENT_NAME

CLIENT_KEY is the indentification key assigned to
this client by the server.

PATH_TO_PLUGIN is the file system path to a Ruby file
that contains a Scout plugin.

PLUGIN_OPTIONS can be the code for a Ruby Hash or the
path to a YAML options file containing defaults.  These
options will be used for the plugin run.

NEW_CLIENT_NAME is name you wish to use for the new
client the server creates.


== Cloning a Client

The Scout gem can clone an existing client to automate the process of setting up additional clients.

An example usage, running:

 server1 $ scout clone CLIENT_KEY 'My New Client'

Will create a new client called 'My New Client' on the Scout server with the same plugins as an already existing client (with the CLIENT_KEY specified).  It will also return the new system crontab line:

  */30 * * * *  deploy /usr/bin/scout NEW_CLIENT_KEY
